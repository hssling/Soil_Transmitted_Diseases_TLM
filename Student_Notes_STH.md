# Student Notes: Soil Transmitted Diseases (STH) for MBBS 3rd Year

## Overview
Soil Transmitted Diseases (STH), also known as Soil Transmitted Helminthiases, are parasitic worm infections transmitted through soil contaminated with feces. They are major public health problems in developing countries, especially affecting children.

### Key Parasites
- **Ascaris lumbricoides** (Roundworm)
- **Trichuris trichiura** (Whipworm)
- **Necator americanus & Ancylostoma duodenale** (Hookworms)

## Module 1: Epidemiology and Burden
- **Global Burden**: 1.5 billion people infected (24% of world population)
- **Geographic Distribution**: Highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia (India has 225 million cases)
- **Vulnerable Groups**: Children (highest prevalence), pregnant women, immunocompromised
- **Risk Factors**: Poverty, poor sanitation, open defecation, geophagia
- **Health Impact**: 4.98 million DALYs, growth retardation, anemia, cognitive impairment
- **Economic Cost**: $7-12 billion annually
- **WHO Targets**: 90% coverage, 75% prevalence reduction by 2030

## Module 2: Etiology and Life Cycle
- **Transmission**: Fecal-oral (Ascaris, Trichuris), percutaneous (Hookworms)
- **Life Cycle Stages**:
  - Egg production → Environmental development → Infection → Migration → Maturation
- **Environmental Requirements**: Warm, humid soil; 5-8 days for hookworm larvae
- **Basic Reproduction Number**: 2-5 (highly contagious)

### Comparative Life Cycles
| Parasite | Infective Stage | Primary Route | Development Time |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Ascaris  | Embryonated egg| Fecal-oral    | 3-4 weeks       |
| Trichuris| Embryonated egg| Fecal-oral    | 3-6 weeks       |
| Hookworm| Filariform larva| Percutaneous  | 5-8 days        |

## Module 3: Clinical Manifestations
- **Asymptomatic**: 60-80% of infections
- **Intensity Classification**:
  - Light: 1-49,999 EPG (eggs per gram)
  - Moderate: 1,000-49,999 EPG
  - Heavy: ≥50,000 EPG

### Symptom Complexes
- **Ascaris**:
  - Pulmonary: Loeffler's syndrome (cough, dyspnea, eosinophilia)
  - Intestinal: Abdominal pain, obstruction, biliary complications
- **Trichuris**:
  - Dysentery syndrome: Bloody diarrhea, rectal prolapse, anemia
- **Hookworm**:
  - Acute: Ground itch, pulmonary symptoms
  - Chronic: Iron deficiency anemia, edema, edema

### Complications
- Intestinal obstruction (Ascaris)
- Rectal prolapse (Trichuris)
- Severe anemia (Hookworm)
- Growth retardation and malnutrition (all)

## Module 4: Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Geographic/treatment history, symptoms
- **Laboratory Diagnosis**:
  - **Stool Examination**: Direct smear, Kato-Katz (gold standard)
  - **Egg Characteristics**:
    - Ascaris: Oval, golden brown, mamillated shell
    - Trichuris: Barrel-shaped, bipolar plugs
    - Hookworm: Oval, clear shell
- **Advanced Methods**: PCR, LAMP for surveillance

### Specimen Collection
- Fresh stool samples, 3 consecutive days
- Kato-Katz: Glycerol-malachite green staining, 41.7 mg template

## Module 5: Treatment and Management
### First-Line Drugs
- **Albendazole**: 400 mg single dose (95-100% efficacy for Ascaris)
- **Mebendazole**: 500 mg single dose
- **Pyrantel pamoate**: 10 mg/kg (safe in pregnancy)

### Treatment Strategies
- **Mass Drug Administration (MDA)**: Preventive chemotherapy
- **Targeted Treatment**: Symptomatic cases
- **Special Populations**:
  - Pregnant women: Albendazole after 1st trimester
  - Children <2 years: Age-appropriate dosing
  - Immunocompromised: More frequent follow-up

### Complications Management
- **Severe Anemia**: Tranfusion if Hb <7 g/dL, iron supplementation
- **Intestinal Obstruction**: Conservative (IV fluids, NG decompression) or surgical

## Module 6: Prevention and Control
### WHO Control Framework
- **Preventive Chemotherapy**: School-based deworming
- **WASH Interventions**: Sanitation, hygiene education
- **Health Education**: Community mobilization
- **Intersectoral Coordination**: Multi-sectoral approach

### Strategies
- **MDA Coverage**: ≥75% in school-age children every 1-2 years
- **WASH**: Protected water, latrines, handwashing, shoe-wearing
- **Hygiene Promotion**: Food hygiene, personal hygiene
- **Monitoring**: Prevalence surveys, drug efficacy testing

### Success Examples
- Japan, South Korea: Eliminated through intensive programs
- Bangladesh: Significant reductions with combined approaches

## Indian Context (Key Points)
- Highest absolute burden globally (225 million cases)
- Rural areas: Open defecation prevalent
- Schools: Integration with child health programs
- MDA: Through National Deworming Day (twice annually)

## Public Health Significance
- **Sustainable Development Goals**: Target 3.3 (NTDs elimination)
- **Cost-Effective**: $0.02-0.50 per treatment
- **Co-Benefits**: Improved nutrition, education, productivity
- **Challenges**: Drug resistance, climate change, urbanization

## Key Take-Home Messages
1. STH are preventable with simple interventions
2. Prevention better than cure (hygiene, sanitation)
3. Children are most affected - early treatment crucial
4. MDA is cornerstone of control programs
5. Integration with WASH essential for sustainable control
