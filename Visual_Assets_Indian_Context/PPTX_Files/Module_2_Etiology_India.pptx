## Slide 10: Host Factors - Indian Population
**Age Distribution:**
- **Children (1-4 years):** Highest intensity infections
- **School-age (5-14 years):** Highest prevalence (school transmission)
- **Adults:** Reservoir of infection, lower intensity
- **Elderly:** Chronic complications more common

**Nutritional Status:**
- **Malnourished children:** Higher susceptibility
- **Iron deficiency:** Increases hookworm severity
- **Vitamin A deficiency:** Common comorbidity

## Slide 11: Socioeconomic Determinants
**Poverty and STH:**
- **Below Poverty Line families:** 3.2 times higher risk
- **Illiterate mothers:** 2.1 times higher risk
- **Overcrowding:** Increases person-to-person transmission
- **Poor housing:** Facilitates environmental contamination

**Occupational Exposure:**
